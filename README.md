## Use: Final Integrated Project

At Fanshawes Interative-Media Design and Production, in place of a final exam, we have been challenged with a sort of practical exam. Which is to build a website using html and css with a three page minimum. Containing 100% of our own original content. For this project I didn't have anything like a real world website build opportunity so I decided to make something more ficticious. This resulted in the idea for "Paralocal", a website about haunted locations in Canada. However, seeing as the pictures needed to be my own original captures, I decided to narrow my view to haunted locations located locally. So, now I have created a webiste called paralocal, containing three pages; a homepage, a haunted grounds page (detailing the huanted locations in and around london ontario), and a contact page. The code for which can be found withing this file.
