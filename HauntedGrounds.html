                <p>In the town of St.Thomas there is a legend about a tall imposing tombstone, surrounded by four post and black as soot. They say a witch, Maria Ermatinger, is buried there and the the stone has been blackened by fire after bursting into flames one night. Also, that her familiar, a black cat, who has lived ever since she was buried it rumored to patrol the graveyard disappearing when people try to come close to it. People are warned that if you stand within the four posts on a night of a full moon, Maria will steal your soul from you.<br>
                In reality however, Maria was married to Reverend Maurice Baldwin and came from a wealthy family who gave her a lavish funeral and headstone to match, having died from an infection contracted during childbirth. Her grave and posts are made of white sandstone that have blackened over the years from acid rain. The four post were common of the time, usually connected by a chain to signify wealth. This style of gravesite was common for the time, leading to the existence of many rumoured "witches graves". Despite knowing this, many warn against standing inside of the four posts when the chain is gone.

However the blue mist itself is disputed as to weather it is a ghost, or something else entirely. Some saying it is a portal to the other side which attacks soul from areas near by. One such area near by is St. Peter's Cemetery which in the 1920's was flooded to make way for a canal. Resulting in hikers finding human remains on the exposed banks during the dry season's. Roaming souls from the disturbed graves are thought to be wandering the tunnel, looking for the other side. Visitors to this tunnel, which only saw three years of service, report feeling pushed when entering the tunnel, sensing someone walking behind them when no one is there along with sightings of apparitions.</p>

However, during its brief early years, it was a well respected and "revolutionary" care center. After many more years of Mental Health Care, it closed its doors in 2014, sitting lost and abandoned to decay slowly while the land sits for sale. Reports of figures seen in the broken boarded up windows and voices behind heard from inside rose steaply in recent years. Leading residents and online communities to believe the old hospital to be haunted. Unfortunately, it is most likely that the cause of these experiences is the rise in popularity of "urban explorer's" who take pictures and videos of abandoned buildings. However, those who have ventured inside report strange noises, footsteps in distant hallways and whispers. There are no lasting reports from previous staff to cooberate this experiences.</p>

Nearly 3,400 residents of the town showed up to spectate his public execution and were horrified when his heavy weight resulted in the nose decapitating him instantly. After the execution, a death mask as made, taking a plaster model of his face, and hung by the door to the then prison yard as a mindful sight for the prisoners.<br>
                In 1982, it was decided to take the mask down. However, everyday after something bizarre happened, lights would flicker on and off, books and files would be thrown from desk top, and a ghostly apparition was seen rarely. Thinking it best, the staff re-hung the mask and instantly the paranormal activities ceased.
